## What is an SCM?
SCM stands for Software Configuration Management and it is the process of taking care of/keeping tabs on changes and maintaining management of a software. This works very well for testing phases of software.

## How does GitHub Help?
Github helps with this in many ways, some examples are that github keeps track of changes to the software, allows you to seperate and organize files wherever needed, allows you to share your software with other people you may be working with, and also allows for pull requests that way you can review your code before fully inputting into the github.
